sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev
```

#### Install required libraries

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## Folder Descriptions
`custom targets` : different target labels for training LSTMs and for optimization

`data` : minute-level data and daily price data

`envs` : multiple versions of our environments for reinforcement learning 

`models` : trained models of different reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, DDPG, PPO, A2CKER)

`strategies` : traditional benchmark strategies (buy-and-hold and momentum)

`synthetic_data` : data generated by LSTM for the prediction period

`utils` : helper functions for data processing, data cleaning, evaluation metrics, optimizations, etc.


## Scripts
