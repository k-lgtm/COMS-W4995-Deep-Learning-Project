```
## Folder Descriptions
data : minute-level data and daily price data

envs : multiple versions of our environments for reinforcement learning 

models : trained models of different reinforcement learning algorithms

strategies : traditional benchmark strategies (buy-and-hold and momentum)

synthetic data : synethetic data generated by LSTM for the prediction period

utils : helper functions for data processing, data cleaning, evaluation metrics, optimizations, etc.



## Main Scripts

Run `benchmarks.ipynb` for performance against traditional financial benchmarks

Run `competition.ipynb` for CUDL financial competition methods

Run `LSTM.ipynb` for CUDL financial using LSTM

Run `multi_agents.ipynb` for performance against multiple reinforcement learning agents
